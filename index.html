<!-- Futurelearn HTML Exercise C2.3 -->

<!-- This is a comment, and won't appear on the page. Follow the instructions in the comments. -->

<!-- This is the CodePen HTML editor; it contains the code for the page you can see below. You are going to write code in here. -->

<!-- 
  You've been sent the copy for a restaurant website (it is beneath the instructions). However, you can see from the page preview that it needs turning into more of a webpage! Your job is to mark up the restaurant website below with HTML.

  You're going to add the appropriate HTML to the content to make a page. The page will slowly look better as you add more code. (This is because a little CSS has already been added for you!)

  Follow the guidance below. It is suggested you work on each type of tag in turn - for instance, read the section on "HEADINGS" and then scroll down to add some headings to the code. Then return to the next instruction.

  1. HEADINGS

  Headings look like this <h1>Words in a heading</h1>
  There are six possible levels of heading, from 'h1' to 'h6'.

  You should put ONE h1 on the page; make the most important heading on the page an h1. 
  Anything else you think should be a heading should be an h2.

  Go and read the page below - then add some headings where you think appropriate, and return to this point in the instructions.
  
  2. IMAGES

  There's a picture of a tortilla on the page. Here's the image you should use:

  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Tortilla_de_patata_y_cebolla.JPG/800px-Tortilla_de_patata_y_cebolla.JPG

  An image tag is <img>. 
  The URL of the image in question should be put in the 'src' element of the image tag.
  Image tags do not need a closing tag. For example:
  <img src="URL_of_image">

  Find the comment below requesting an image, and insert the image tag with the photo mentioned above. Then return to this point in the instructions.

  3. TABLES

  The menu should be marked up as a table. An item and its price should be on the same row, in two different table cells.

  - wrap the whole table in a <table> tag.
  - wrap each row of a table in a <tr> tag ("Table Row").
  - wrap each cell of each row in a <td> tag ("Table Data cell")
  
  Mark up the menu now, and return here.

  4. LISTS

  There is one bulleted list on the page ("Unordered List"). To mark up a list:

  - wrap the whole list in a <ul> tag
  - wrap each item inside the list in <li> tags.

  Find the text that should be a list, mark it up, and return here.

  5. PARAGRAPHS

  Text paragraphs that don't fall into the above categories should be wrapped in <p> tags.
  To place a line break inside a paragraph - for instance, in an address - you can end the line with <br>

  Mark up the paragraphs and any line breaks you think should be in them. When you've finished this task, you've completed the exercise. Keep this window open, and return to FutureLearn. You'll have the opportunity to discuss the exercise, and watch the Lead Educator show their solution to the problem.
